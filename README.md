In words.c, we first process data depending on whether it is a file or a directory. The program will call the function process_directory if it finds a subdirectory, and will pass any entry that begins with a ".". If the entry ends in ".txt", the fucntion process_file will be called.

Once reading the data in from either the .txt file or from the directory, we opted to use a data structure that crates an array of structs that can hold the name of a word, aswell as a counter for how many times it occurs. We use the function word_finder() to check to see if a word already exists. if it returns -1, then word_add will add one to the counter of that word. The words are then printed lexicographically and order by most occuring at the top.

Through our testing we examined the following: repeated words, capitalization, apostrophes before, in the middle, of and after words, punctuation marks, and exclamation marks. We applied this to multiple .txt files as well as directories in an effort to be thorough. As we quickly discovered after reading the design doc, the definition of a word is not the same as a word in the English language. A more thorough set of test cases would also have included every character in ASCII and more attempts to crash our own program by overwhelming ourselves with both large files and a large number of files.
